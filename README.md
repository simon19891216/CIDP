CIDP is a software for designing sgRNAs in CRISPR system.

So many sgRNA-design tools have been published. Most of them require users to select a closely-related species for completing the designing process. 

However, there are still huge differences in sequences between the species of interest and the closely-related species. Not to mention that some researchers have difficulties in finding a closely-related species from the database of the sgRNA-design tools. The situation is particularly serious in plant researchã€‚

Therefore, we developed CIDP that allows users to build the database using the input genomic sequences instead of choosing a closely-related species. Furthermore, apart from designing sgRNAs, CIDP can perform the functions of designing primers and extracting required sequences from genome-sequence files.

CIDP is an open-source software. The source code will be published as soon as the related article has been accepted.
